The goal of this \"personal\" model, is to have a more hand-on work and try to adjust parameters manually. By transforming the Difficulty levels into numeric values, we can try to compute feature values and through them, compute a new score for each sentence.*\n","\n","In this third and last notebook we do some final and more advanced feature adjustements and some more detailed preprocessing.\n","The feature we add to this version is the number of cognates per sentence. The goal is to include the impact that any cognate can have on a sentence. We do that by standardizing the number of cognates per sentence and then giving it a certain weight to use it for the computation of the new Score. We do the same weight operation for the other features as well.\n","\n","Here, again, we use a reduced version of the train dataset from AICrowd, only now we load the test dataset also."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WFnkYhTn0lH-"},"source":["### Installing and importing the necessary libraries and packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uf7kou_BLUy1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622320256321,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7616,"user":{"displayName":"Agon Husejni","photoUrl":"","userId":"09433107798316841874"}},"outputId":"3eaef527-bdab-4280-e6e6-afa50e3e06a7"},"source":["!pip install unidecode\n","!pip install textstat"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting unidecode\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9e/25/723487ca2a52ebcee88a34d7d1f5a4b80b793f179ee0f62d5371938dfa01/Unidecode-1.2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (241kB)\n","\r\u001b[K     |█▍                              | 10kB 16.0MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██▊                             | 20kB 19.6MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████                            | 30kB 22.4MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████▍                          | 40kB 25.1MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████▉                         | 51kB 10.9MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████▏                       | 61kB 12.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████▌                      | 71kB 8.7MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |██████████▉                     | 81kB 7.0MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████▏                   | 92kB 7.2MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████▋                  | 102kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████                 | 112kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████▎               | 122kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████████▋              | 133kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████             | 143kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████▍           | 153kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████████████▊          | 163kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████████         | 174kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████▍       | 184kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████████████████▊      | 194kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████████████▏    | 204kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████▌   | 215kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |█████████████████████████████▉  | 225kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |███████████████████████████████▏| 235kB 7.5MB/s eta 0:00:01\r\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 245kB 7.5MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: unidecode\n","Successfully installed unidecode-1.2.0\n","Collecting textstat\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ce/42/3e3691ff23d2f3e30ef18bd382d9450e992e2da7e01ca33d392b473eba05/textstat-0.7.1-py3-none-any.whl (99kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 102kB 6.3MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hCollecting pyphen\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7c/5a/5bc036e01389bc6a6667a932bac3e388de6e7fa5777a6ff50e652f60ec79/Pyphen-0.10.0-py3-none-any.whl (1.9MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 1.9MB 13.1MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pyphen, textstat\n","Successfully installed pyphen-0.10.0 textstat-0.7.1\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SV8xe4OITt95","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622320285523,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":22045,"user":{"displayName":"Agon Husejni","photoUrl":"","userId":"09433107798316841874"}},"outputId":"725eb6e4-06d6-48f7-f39e-931d412488db"},"source":["!pip install wordstats\n","!pip install nltk\n","!pip install spacy download fr"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting wordstats\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7f/79/8f10b9836162ba987f85cd92d61993e4c0bc5ad408be1b7b217ec5a4a6fb/wordstats-1.0.7.tar.gz (3.6MB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 3.6MB 7.6MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hCollecting configobj\n","  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/64/61/079eb60459c44929e684fa7d9e2fdca403f67d64dd9dbac27296be2e0fab/configobj-5.0.6.tar.gz\n","Requirement already satisfied: sqlalchemy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from wordstats) (1.4.15)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from configobj->wordstats) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata;
